* raylib_game_template
  This is template for running raylib games and building them for web using emscripten or desktop

** Configuration
 edit file named ~config.env~ before running scripts
   #+begin_src bash
     # pick platform "WEB" or "DESKTOP"
     RAYLIB_SETUP_PLATFORM="WEB"  
     #RAYLIB_SETUP_PLATFORM="DESKTOP"  
     
     # set to true or false based on preferences
     RAYLIB_USE_RAYGUI=true     # RAYGUI raygui is immediate-mode-gui library.
     RAYLIB_USE_RPNG=true       # RPNG is library to load/save png images and manage png chunks.
     RAYLIB_USE_RAUDIO=true     # raudio is audio library based on miniaudio.
     RAYLIB_USE_RRES=true       # rres is file-format to package resources
     RAYLIB_USE_NBNET=true      # NBNET is library designed to implement client-server architecture
   #+end_src
 
** Scripts
   #+begin_src bash
     # this script will pull all dependancies specified in config.env 
     # and setup everytihing for development according to config.env settings
     ./scripts/setup_raylib.sh  
     
     # this script will build game for platform specified in config.env
     ./scripts/build.sh         
 
     # this script will clean everytihing
     ./scripts/clean.sh
 
     # this script will run game. Remember to setup_raylib for DESKTOP before running it
     ./scripts/run_desktop.sh
     
     # this script will run web server for testing web build
     ./scripts/start_web_server.sh.sh
 
   #+end_src
** Dekstop build 
   - change RAYLIB_SETUP_PLATFORM to "DESKTOP" in config.env
   - setup for desktop
   #+begin_src bash
     ./scripts/setup_raylib.sh.sh
   #+end_src
   - create build
   #+begin_src bash
     ./scripts/build.sh
   #+end_src
   - or just run game
   #+begin_src bash
     ./scripts/run_desktop.sh
   #+end_src
** Web build 
   - change RAYLIB_SETUP_PLATFORM to "WEB" in config.env
   - setup for web
   #+begin_src bash
     ./scripts/setup_raylib.sh.sh
   #+end_src
   - create web build
   #+begin_src bash
     ./scripts/build.sh
   #+end_src
   - You can start web server with python
   #+begin_src bash
     ./scripts/run_desktop.sh
   #+end_src
   - go to this address: http://0.0.0.0:8000/main.html
** Dependancies
   - gcc with all libraries (needed to build code)
   - make (needed in build)
   - git (needed to pull dependancies)
   - bash (needed in order to run bash scripts)
   - python3 (for running server)
   - LINUX based operating system (untested on other)
