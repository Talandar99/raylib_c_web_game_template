* raylib_game_template
  This is template for running raylib games and building them for web using emscripten or desktop

** Configuration
 edit file named ~config.env~ before running scripts
   #+begin_src bash
    # pick platform "WEB" or "DESKTOP"
    RAYLIB_SETUP_PLATFORM="DESKTOP"  
    
    # set to true or false based on preferences
    # RAYGUI raygui is immediate-mode-gui library.
    RAYLIB_USE_RAYGUI=true     
    # RPNG is library to load/save png images and manage png chunks.
    RAYLIB_USE_RPNG=false      
    # raudio is audio library based on miniaudio.
    RAYLIB_USE_RAUDIO=false    
    # rres is file-format to package resources
    RAYLIB_USE_RRES=false      
    # NBNET is library designed to implement client-server architecture
    RAYLIB_USE_NBNET=false     
   #+end_src
 
** Scripts
   #+begin_src bash
    make help                     # Show this help message
    make deps                     # Download necessary dependencies and run setup_raylib_platform
    make setup_raylib_platform    # Setup raylib for the selected platform
    make build                    # Build the project based on the selected platform
    make web_run                  # Build and run web version with HTTP server
    make desktop_run              # Build and run desktop version
    make clean                    # Clean the build and dependencies
   #+end_src
** Getting dependencies
   before building anything remember to get needed libraries
   #+begin_src bash
    make deps                     # Download necessary dependencies and run setup_raylib_platform
   #+end_src

** Dekstop build 
   - change RAYLIB_SETUP_PLATFORM to "DESKTOP" in config on top of Makefile
   - setup for desktop
   #+begin_src bash
    make setup_raylib_platform    # Setup raylib for the selected platform
   #+end_src
   - create build
   #+begin_src bash
    make build                    # Build the project based on the selected platform
   #+end_src
   - or just run game
   #+begin_src bash
    make desktop_run              # Build and run desktop version
   #+end_src
** Web build 
   - change RAYLIB_SETUP_PLATFORM to "WEB" in config on top of Makefile
   - setup for web
   #+begin_src bash
    make setup_raylib_platform    # Setup raylib for the selected platform
   #+end_src
   - create web build
   #+begin_src bash
     ./scripts/build.sh
   #+end_src
   - You can start web server with python
   #+begin_src bash
     ./scripts/run_desktop.sh
   #+end_src
   - go to this address: http://0.0.0.0:8000/main.html
** Dependancies
   - gcc with all libraries (needed to build code)
   - make (needed in build)
   - git (needed to pull dependancies)
   - bash (needed in order to run bash scripts)
   - python3 (for running server)
   - LINUX based operating system (untested on other)
